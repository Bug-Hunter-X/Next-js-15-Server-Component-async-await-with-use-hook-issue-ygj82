# Next.js 15 Server Component Async/Await with `use` Hook Issue

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Next.js 15 related to the interaction between server components, the `async/await` pattern, and custom hooks utilizing the `use` hook.  The bug results in the `use` hook not properly updating the component after an asynchronous operation within a server component completes. 

## Problem

When using `async/await` inside a function within a Next.js 15 server component that also utilizes a custom hook with `use`, the hook might not correctly update the component's state or re-render when the asynchronous operation finishes. This can lead to stale data or incorrect UI updates.

## Solution

The provided solution addresses the issue by restructuring the component's logic to properly manage the asynchronous operation and the `use` hook's lifecycle. This ensures the data fetched asynchronously correctly updates the UI, leading to the expected behavior.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the behavior of the application.
